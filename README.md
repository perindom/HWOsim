# HWOsim
Simulating NASA HWO Observatory Data Streams using existing archival (batched) data.


## Description

### Objective

This project focuses on developing a data engineering pipeline to simulate future [NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory] (https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/) (HWO) data streams, leveraging archives from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The goal is to provide a realistic, high-fidelity data environment for AI models that will be deployed to analyze live-streamed data from the HWO mission. A vital component of this simulation is data perturbation. This technique introduces controlled imperfections, such as noise, missing values, and data drift, to mimic the unpredictable nature of real-world data.
